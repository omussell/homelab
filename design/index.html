<h1 id="bootstrapping-a-secure-infrastructure">Bootstrapping a Secure Infrastructure</h1>
<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>Create an infrastructure with an emphasis on security, resiliency and ease of maintenance.</p>
<h2 id="end-goal">End Goal</h2>
<p>Produce a working implementation of a secure, resilient and easy to maintain infrastructure. This will be published in the form of version-controlled configuration documents, with the philosophy and background of the chosen configuration documented here. Anyone should be able to download the vendor supplied base operating system, and the configuration documents should convert that base OS into the desired state. The process by which this conversion is achieved could be as simple as a shell script, or as complicated as a configuration management tool backed by continuous deployment pipelines. In addition, the infrastructure should be flexible enough to be deployed in multiple configurations based on the decisions of the Infrastructure Architects and business owners. It should also be portable to other operating systems with only a little massage of the configuration code.</p>
<h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<p>The design of the environment will be similar to the MIT Athena project and the Distributed Computing Environment by the OSF. Inspiration for this project comes from the infrastructures.org website, specifically their papers: &quot;Bootstrapping an Infrastructure&quot; and &quot;Why Order Matters: Turing Equivalence in Automated Systems Administration&quot;. Additionally, a paper written by Paul Schenkeveld, &quot;Building servers with NanoBSD, ZFS and jails&quot; served as inspiration for the use of NanoBSD as the operating system due to its unique properties.</p>
<p>This project aims to extend the work of infrastructures.org and Paul Schenkeveld, by emphasising security and producing a working implementation that can be used by anyone.</p>
<p>The implementation can take multiple forms. The envisioned configuration is a closed network, that is, sites are connected using secure tunnels over the insecure internet where each site is independent of the others.</p>
<p>Decentralised - Each site is independent and can function without a connection to the internet. Headquarters - Main site(s), connected to other sites</p>
<p>In any of these scenarios, the administrators can provide end-users with access to the network in multiple ways: Thick client Thin client BYOD Web access only</p>
<p>In addition, a &quot;server&quot; can take many forms, it could be a Jail/Zone/Container, virtual machine, physical or cloud.</p>
<p>Also, while the envisioned configuration is a closed network, where nothing is accessible via the normal internet, there is no requirement for this to be so. If you want end-users to be able to access your network from home or via BYOD they can.</p>

<p>Key features of NanoBSD:</p>
<ul>
<li>Offline build of complete system images</li>
<li>Dual system images</li>
<li>Read-only root filesystem</li>
<li>Separate storage of modified configuration files, which is shared between the two system images.</li>
</ul>
<p>Key features of Jails:</p>
<ul>
<li>A process and all descendants are restricted to a chrooted directory tree</li>
<li>Does not rely on virtualisation, so performance penalty is mitigated</li>
<li>Easy to update or upgrade individual jails</li>
</ul>
<p>Key features of ZFS:</p>
<ul>
<li>Data integrity using checksums</li>
<li>Pooled storage, where all disks added to the pool are available to all filesystems</li>
<li>High performance with multiple caching mechanisms</li>

<p>Control machine config, Git, SSH, 2FA? Gold server, how are changes propagated? git repo hosted on this server, which each derivative server pulls from? system images can be sent via dd over SSH. Main servers - DNS in the form of NSD for authoritative, Unbound for resolving. OpenDNSSEC for key signing, keys stored in SoftHSM. DANE used for D/TLS auth. Kerberos for auth, with LDAP directory services. Everything should be authenticated with Kerberos, SSH, PKINIT, IPsec via KINK, inter-server communication, mail access etc. KerberizedNFSv4 for client file access.<br />Clients, create a thin client build, Irssi-OTR with OpenPGP keys stored in DNS/LDAP</p>
