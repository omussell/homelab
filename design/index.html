<h1 id="summary"><a href="#TOC">Summary</a></h1>
<p>Create an infrastructure with an emphasis on security, resiliency and ease of maintenance.</p>
<h1 id="end-goal"><a href="#TOC">End Goal</a></h1>
<p>Produce a working implementation of a secure, resilient and easy to maintain infrastructure. This will be published in the form of version-controlled configuration documents, with the philosophy and background of the chosen configuration documented here. Anyone should be able to download the vendor supplied base operating system, and the configuration documents should convert that base OS into the desired state. The process by which this conversion is achieved could be as simple as a shell script, or as complicated as a configuration management tool backed by continuous deployment pipelines. In addition, the infrastructure should be flexible enough to be deployed in multiple configurations based on the decisions of the Infrastructure Architects and business owners. It should also be portable to other operating systems with only a little massage of the configuration code.</p>
<h1 id="background"><a href="#TOC">Background</a></h1>
<p>The design of the environment will be similar to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Athena">Project Athena</a> at MIT and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_Computing_Environment">Distributed Computing Environment</a> by the OSF. Inspiration for this project comes from the <a href="http://www.infrastructures.org">infrastructures.org</a> website, specifically their papers: <a href="http://www.infrastructures.org/papers/bootstrap/bootstrap.html">Bootstrapping an Infrastructure</a> and <a href="http://www.infrastructures.org/papers/turing/turing.html">Why Order Matters: Turing Equivalence in Automated Systems Administration</a>. Additionally, a paper by Paul Schenkeveld, <a href="https://2010.asiabsdcon.org/papers/abc2010-P4A-paper.pdf">Building servers with NanoBSD, ZFS and Jails</a> served as inspiration for the use of NanoBSD as the operating system due to its unique properties.</p>
<p>This project aims to extend the work of infrastructures.org and Paul Schenkeveld, by emphasising security and producing a working implementation that can be used by anyone.</p>
<p>!!</p>
<p>The implementation can take multiple forms. The envisioned configuration is a closed network, that is, sites are connected using secure tunnels over the insecure internet where each site is independent of the others. In addition, there is no dependance on the internet infrastructure such as third-party certificate authorities or DNS providers. This means that the Root CA and Root DNS zone are managed locally.</p>
<p>Decentralised - Each site is independent and can function without a connection to the internet.</p>
<p>Headquarters - Main site(s), connected to other sites</p>
<p>In any of these scenarios, the administrators can provide end-users with access to the network in multiple ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Thick client</li>
<li>Thin client</li>
<li>BYOD</li>
<li>Web access only</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, a “server” can take many forms, it could be a Jail/Zone/Container, virtual machine, physical or cloud.</p>
<p>Also, while the envisioned configuration is a closed network, where nothing is accessible via the normal internet, there is no requirement for this to be so. If you want end-users to be able to access your network from home or via BYOD they can.</p>
<p>!!</p>
<h1 id="high-level-design"><a href="#TOC">High-Level Design</a></h1>
<ul>
<li>Control Machine - Stores operating system images and configuration files in version control. Used to create the Gold server.</li>
<li>Gold server - In the form of a created system image</li>
<li>Infrastructure servers - Provides directory, domain names, authentication/authorisation services</li>
<li>Data storage - Provide clients with access to their data/files via network file systems.</li>
<li>Clients - End use</li>
</ul>
<img src="/homelab/pic/secenv.svg"> <img src="/homelab/pic/disklayout.svg">
<p>The general server design would be a generic NanoBSD image occupying a flash device such as SD card serving as the operating system. Physical drives (either spinning disk or SSD) will be formatted with ZFS, on top of which the base for the jails will reside. Data used by the applications such as databases are stored on discrete storage appliances.</p>
<p>The advantages of this setup are:</p>
<p>NanoBSD:</p>
<ul>
<li>Offline build of complete system images</li>
<li>Dual system images</li>
<li>Read-only root filesystem</li>
<li>Separate storage of modified configuration files, which is shared between the two system images.</li>
</ul>
<p>Jails:</p>
<ul>
<li>A process and all descendants are restricted to a chrooted directory tree</li>
<li>Does not rely on virtualisation, so performance penalty is mitigated</li>
<li>Easy to update or upgrade individual jails</li>
</ul>
<p>ZFS:</p>
<ul>
<li>Data integrity using checksums</li>
<li>Pooled storage, where all disks added to the pool are available to all filesystems</li>
<li>High performance with multiple caching mechanisms</li>
<li>Snapshots</li>
</ul>
<p>This also gives administrators the flexibility to compile a custom kernel/image in order to include files/packages/kernel modules as part of the image. Doing so could result in faster boot times due to the kernel not having to query the hardware, and a reduced attack surface since unneeded components are removed. This comes at the cost of higher complexity and more difficult maintenance.</p>
<p>The DNS, NTP, Auth, LDAP services are required by all derivative applications.</p>
<p>!!</p>
<p>Directory servers comes in the form of DNS, using NSD as an authoritative name server, and Unbound for validating, caching and resolving servers. DNSSEC is implemented via OpenDNSSEC. SoftHSM is used for key storage (though a physical HSM would be necessary for prod). CA using OpenSSL. DANE used for D/TLS auth. Heimdal Kerberos backed by OpenLDAP. Kerberized Internet Negotiation of Keys (KINK) used for the security aspect of VPN over IPsec, used to connect sites to one another. SSH also uses Kerberos for password authentication in addition to public key authentication. OpenNTPd for time.</p>
<p>KerberizedNFSv4 for client file access.</p>
<p>!!</p>
<h1 id="experimental"><a href="#TOC">Experimental</a></h1>
<p>Features that aren’t production ready, but would be interesting to implement: SSH using X509v3 certificates, signed by a central CA (or validated with DANE?) TLS using SIDH with the Microsoft Research OpenSSL patch (also validated with DANE?)</p>
<h1 id="detailed-design"><a href="#TOC">Detailed Design</a></h1>
<p>Control machine config, Git, SSH, 2FA? Gold server, how are changes propagated? git repo hosted on this server, which each derivative server pulls from? system images can be sent via dd over SSH. Main servers - DNS in the form of NSD for authoritative, Unbound for resolving. OpenDNSSEC for key signing, keys stored in SoftHSM. DANE used for D/TLS auth. Kerberos for auth, with LDAP directory services. Everything should be authenticated with Kerberos, SSH, PKINIT, IPsec via KINK, inter-server communication, mail access etc. KerberizedNFSv4 for client file access.<br />Clients, create a thin client build, Irssi-OTR with OpenPGP keys stored in DNS/LDAP</p>
<h2 id="ipv6"><a href="#TOC">IPv6</a></h2>
<p>IPv6 is the latest version of the IP protocol, which offers significant advantages over IPv4. The much larger address space, 2^128, allows more devices on the same subnet. The standard subnet size of 2^64 equates to the square of the entire IPv4 address space. Using Stateless address autoconfiguration (<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4862">SLAAC</a>), IPv6 hosts can configure themselves automatically when connected to an IPv6 network using the <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4861">Neighbor Discovery Protocol</a> (NDP) via ICMPv6 router discovery messages. The IPv6 router will be allocated a subnet by the ISP and configured with the first 64 bits of the 128-bit address. <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4862#section-5.4">Duplicate Address Detection</a> and <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4861#section-7.3">Neighbor Unreachability Detection</a> serve as error handling for the address autoconfiguration. Since the IPv6 addresses are generated from the prefix on the router, it is possible to renumber an entire network by changing the prefix on the router.</p>
<p>IPv6 address are mapped to hostnames in DNS using <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3596">AAAA resource records</a>. Reverse resolution uses the ip6.arpa domain.</p>

<p>Security associations via IKE or KINK</p>
<h3 id="kink"><a href="#TOC">KINK</a></h3>
<p><a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4430">Kerberized Internet Negotiation of Keys</a> (KINK) defines a protocol to establish and maintain security associations using the Kerberos authentication system. The central key management provided by Kerberos is efficient because it limits computational cost and limits complexity versus IKE’s necessity of using public key cryptography. Initial authentication to the KDC may be performed using asymmetric keys via the <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4556">Public Key Cryptography for Initial Authentication in Kerberos</a> (PKINIT) protocol.</p>

<p>DNS is required to provide hostname to IP mapping.</p>
<h3 id="dnssec"><a href="#TOC">DNSSEC</a></h3>
<p>The DNS Security Extensions or <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2535">DNSSEC</a> add protection for DNS records by allowing resolvers and applications to authenticate the data they receive from DNS servers. [DNS resolution starts at the root], and works down the nameservers until the desired domain name is reached. DNSSEC builds upon this model by creating a chain of trust from the root zone.</p>
<h3 id="dane"><a href="#TOC">DANE</a></h3>
<p>DNS-Based Authentication of Named Entities or <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6698">DANE</a> allows certificates, used by TLS, to be bound to DNS names using DNSSEC. DANE allows you to authenticate the association of the server’s certificate with the domain name without trusting an external certificate authority. Given that the DNS administrator is authoritative for the zone, it makes sense to allow the administrator to also be authoritative for the binding between the domain name and a certificate. This is done with DNS, and the security of the information is verified with DNSSEC.</p>
<p>DANE is implemented by placing TLSA records in the DNS.</p>
<p>TLS via DANE can be used to secure websites over HTTPS, email via the <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7929">OpenPGP</a> and <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-dane-smime-14">S/MIME</a> extensions, instant messaging (XMPP, IRC) and others via SRV records.</p>
<h3 id="dane-for-email-security"><a href="#TOC">DANE for Email Security</a></h3>
<p>Since SMTP was designed to be transmitted in plaintext, encryption in the form of <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3207">STARTTLS</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opportunistic_TLS">Opportunistic TLS</a> was developed to secure email communication. However, <a href="https://blog.fillipo.io/the-sad-state-of-smtp-encryption/">it is known</a> to be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opportunistic_TLS#Weaknesses_and_mitigations">vulnerable to downgrade attacks</a>, since the initial handshake occurs in plain text. An attacker could perform a man-in-the-middle attack by preventing the handshake from taking place and thus make it appear that TLS is unavailable, so clients revert to plain text.</p>
<p>The Electronic Frontier Foundation (<a href="https://www.eff.org">EFF</a>) has created a project called <a href="https://github.com/EFForg/starttls-everywhere">STARTTLS Everywhere</a> in an effort to enforce TLS between popular email domains, with the help of <a href="https://letsencrypt.org">Let’s Encrypt</a> to serve certificates.</p>
<p>However, this is only to serve as an <a href="https://github.com/EFForg/starttls-everywhere#alternatives">intermediate solution</a> until <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-dane-smtp-with-dane-10">DNSSEC and DANE</a> see widespread adoption.</p>
<p>Our implementation includes DNSSEC and DANE, and so email protection will be available. However, since the infrastructure is not designed to be publicly accessible, some unique challenges surrounding maintenance of the DNS and CA root domains require solutions and also how to securely send between organisations needs to be determined.</p>
<p>While DANE can be used to validate the connection between mail exchangers, the emails themselves are still unencrypted. S/MIME and OpenPGP allow emails to be encrypted. There are also standards in place to store DANE bind</p>
<p>A brilliant guide to setting up DNSSEC+DANE to guarantee secure email between organisations is <a href="nccoe.nist.gov/sites/default/files/library/sp1800/dns-secure-email-sp1800-6-draft.pdf">published by NIST</a>. It shows the experiments carried out by Microsoft Corporation, NLnet Laboratories, Secure64, Internet Systems Consortium and Fraunhofer IAO, and includes the configuration required for their respective MUA, MTA and DNS services, including:</p>

<li>Configuration: The configuration should be able to be backed up and restored. You should be able to view the difference between one version and the other. Archive the running configuration while the system is running. This is best done with text files, as they can be stored in existing version control systems

<li><p>Startup and shutdown: Enter drain mode; Stop the applications (optional); Stop the jails (which should have scripts to stop the apps); Shutdown. Startup, start the jails on boot, mount and filesystems in jails; run apps check before saying ready; Exit drain mode.</p></li>
<li><p>Queue draining: All requests are going through the load balancer, individual nodes can be put into drain mode.</p></li>
<li><p>Software upgrades: For app upgrades, snapshot current, update app, restart jail with new updated app jail. For OS upgrades, build new offline image, update slice 2, reboot.</p></li>
<li><p>Backups and restores: Config files / OS files / data files</p>
How to backup and restore:
<ul>
<li>Kerberos principals, groups etc.</li>
<li>LDAP data</li>
<li>DNS records/zones</li>
<li>HSM data Calculate the latency/data limits required to perform above backups/restores</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Redundancy: OS, hard drive, zfs, multiple core servers with master/slave, database replication, multiple load balancers. Services are behind a load balancer</p></li>
<li><p>Replicated databases</p></li>
<li><p>Hot swaps: Physical components should be hot swappable. Service components should also be hot swappable.</p></li>
<li>Access controls and rate limits: If a service provides an API, that API should include an Access Control List</li>
<li>Monitoring: Configuration management tools typically monitor the OS / Application code is correct. Use normal network monitoring tools to monitor up/down, latency etc…</li>
<li><p>Auditing: Logging to central servers</p></li>

<li><p>Working remotely</p></li>
<li>Documents - Access documents through a website? Should be bound by authentication/authorisation. Version controlled documents. Like Sharepoint, but not terrible.</li>
<li>Applications - web-access only preferred, TLS available, bound by authentication/authorisation.</li>
<li>Email - How does ProtonMail do it? Usually a lot of protections and anti-spam required, but if orgs are able to authoritativly validate each other, you are only able to receive emails from those orgs that have been validated, everything else is binned. Or if an org does spam, its quick to pinpoint and can be made untrusted.</li>
<li>Instant Messaging - IRC with OTR, e.g. irc with PGP support.</li>
<li><p>Working remotely - won’t happen in a super-secure infra, but less secure may allow it. Could be done like MIT, with public SSH servers that require Kerberos name+pass and the user certificate. Then you could get X forwarded over SSH or instead of SSH, an SSL/TLS VPN that gives access to the internal network.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="overview"><a href="#TOC">Overview</a></h2>
<p>Check against Digital Ocean writing guide and rubric for correctness. Assumption, that you have the necessary computing resources to build and use these servers Network switches are set up and computers can communicate and/or connect to internet</p>
<p>In the beginning, a computer will need to be connected to the public internet in order to download the operating system files, and other software required to build the initial systems. This will act as the control machine.</p>
<p>Why IPv6? pros and cons. Router Advertisements requirements, and security for Neighbour Discovery protocol should be discussed Why CARP,</p>
<p>The main prerequisite for the infrastructure is an IPv6 capable router. The router will act as the gateway between the open internet and the internal infrastructure. It is preferable to have two identical routers, managed via CARP. The router would also be responsible for NTP from upstream NTP sources, and DHCPv6 if required. Router Advertisement messages will be sent to computers in the infrastructure in order for them to generate their IP address via SLAAC. The routers may also have firewall software configured, if specific hardware firewalls are not used.</p>
<p>Then, the DNS, Authentication, Directory, Domain Naming, Time, Admin services are configured. This allows other systems in the infrastructure to find host naming information, authentication/authorisation information, correct time, etc.</p>
<p>From there, the application servers can pull information they need from the secure infra.</p>
