# Gemini Protocol

=> https://gemini.circumlunar.space/ Project Gemini

```
Gemini is a new, collaboratively designed internet protocol, 
which explores the space inbetween gopher and the web, striving 
to address (perceived) limitations of one while avoiding the 
(undeniable) pitfalls of the other.
```

## Server

For the server I'm using 
=> https://github.com/mbrubeck/agate Agate
.

```
# Download the binary (for Rpi)
wget https://github.com/mbrubeck/agate/releases/download/v2.3.0/agate.aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu.gz
gunzip agate.aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu.gz
mv agate.aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu agate

# Or build from source
git clone https://github.com/mbrubeck/agate
cd agate
cargo build --release
```

Create a certificate with mkcert

Run with:

```
/root/agate/agate \
    --content /root/homelab/gemini \
    --key /root/certs/gemini.matrix-key.pem \
    --cert /root/certs/gemini.matrix.pem \
    --hostname gemini.matrix
```

## Client

For the client I'm using 
=> https://bombadillo.colorfield.space/ bombadillo

```
git clone https://tildegit.org/sloum/bombadillo
cd bombadillo
sudo make install
bombadillo
```

You will need to create a directory with some static files inside. These files should have a file extension of `.gmi` or `.gemini`. The content is structured like a subset of markdown:

```
# Normal text
Hello World!

# Link
=> gemini://example.org/ An Example Link

# Preformatted text
# ```
preformatted text surrounded by 3 backticks
# ```

# Headers using #
# Title
## Sub Title
### Sub Sub Title

# Unordered list
* No
* Particular
* Order

# Quote lines
> This is a good quote
```
