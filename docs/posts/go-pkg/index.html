<p>Now that we&rsquo;ve built the go application and its dependencies we now need to package it up to distribute across the infrastructure.</p>

<h1 id="packaging-with-fpm">Packaging with fpm</h1>

<p>The below command is an example of what we would want to run:</p>

<p><code>fpm -s dir -t freebsd -n ~/go_test --version 1.0.0 --prefix /usr/local/bin go_tests</code></p>

<p>But this has a few issues. Rather than putting the finished package into <code>~/go_test</code>, it would be better in a dedicated directory like <code>/var/packages</code> or similar. The version number is hard coded which obviously isn&rsquo;t always going to be correct. You would want to instead have your CI tool set to only run the packaging command when a new tag/release is created, and then have the version number derived from the tag/release number. It also includes the <code>--prefix</code> flag to specify the path to prepend to any files in the package. This is required as when the package is installed/extracted, the files will be extracted to the full path as specified in the package. So in this instance the <code>/usr/local/bin/go_tests</code> file is extracted.</p>

<p>For now, I&rsquo;m getting by with the following command which will overwrite the finished package if it already exists.</p>

<p><code>fpm -f -s dir -t freebsd -n ~/go_test --prefix /usr/local/bin go_tests</code></p>
